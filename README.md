# CEASimplified
tkinter wrapper for NASA CEA, aimed at reducing complexity and helping beginners.

You can download it at [Source Forge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ceasimplified/), or just clone the project and run it yourself. Just a heads up, the .exe file will tell you it is from an unverified publisher. That's because I didn't pay for verification. Most of the code is in main.py, so that's where I would start if you want to verify it.
